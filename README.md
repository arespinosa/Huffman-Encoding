# Huffman-Encoding

A project where a user is able to compress and uncompress a file. I used the Huffman Compression technique in order to acheive this goal and used mulitple data structures in order to utilize their strengths and fasten the runtimes. 


# What I Learned

* Worked with multiple data structures: Vectors, Queues, & Binary Trees 
* Learned how to read data from files and write data to files. 
* Proficiently engaged with pointers and recursion techniques in order to manage the memory.
